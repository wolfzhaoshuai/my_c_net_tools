# my_c_net_tools
The following tools are programmed with C language under Unix/Linux environments.
My aim is to lead more geeks to know the underlying codes of some popular tools.
And these customized tools are used to monitor a network, stimulate some network attacks and so on.
For example, when I used the tool tcpdump, I hated its output,so I studied its source code, then made some modifications,
and finally I got the formatting outout I like.
